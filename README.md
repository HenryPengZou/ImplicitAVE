## Datasets
Our evaluation and training data are released in the [data](https://github.com/HenryPengZou/ImplicitAVE/tree/main/data) folder. For product images, please download them from the provided links in the corresponding folder and unzip them into the same folder.


## Code
The inference code we used for GPT-4V and BLIP-2, LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-VL-Chat are provided in the [code](https://github.com/HenryPengZou/ImplicitAVE/tree/main/code) folder. You might need to change the paths to your own data paths and replace the model names with other variants you would like to use.
